    <div id="p1"><p class="typed"><span>Hello there, my name is David Joseph Calvez. I prefer to be called as Joseph(I'll strangle you if you call me David, just kidding). I started working as soon as I hit 18 for Teletech way back 2016 and during this time I was in pop-rock band as a bassist/rapper (we are just a cover band playing day6 songs) but I decided to continue my studies in 2017 in Cavite.</span> </p></div>
    <div id="p2"><p  class="typed"><span>After I graduated IT in 2019, I was "forced" to work in the BPO industry since there are no entry-level IT jobs here in Pampanga at that time.</span> </p></div>
    <div id="p3"><p  class="typed"><span>After working for various call centers and a year long stint as a General Admin Assistant, I grew tired of constant calls (I got vocal cord damage) and unreasonable workloads I got depressed and resigned (and experienced some nasty betreyals).</span> </p></div>
    <div id="p4"><p  class="typed"><span>I decided it's time for me to change careers and try what should I've applied for right after I graduated and work in IT since I got a pc that is suitable for remote working and to practice my heavily rusted coding skills(last time i coded is way back 2022 creating a newsletter for my client and I struggled a lot for that since they are so cheap they don't want to use mailchimp and just told me to "create a newsletter").</span> </p></div>

    <div id="p5"><p  class="typed"><span>My hobbies are gaming, binge watching anime, listening to music (I listen to mostly metalcore these days), and bulding gunpla models. I am also a huge wrestling fan and I still can't get over with Cody Rhodes winning the championship since he is one of my favorite wrestlers alongside Rhea Ripley.</span> </p></div>
